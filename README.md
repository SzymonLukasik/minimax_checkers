How to run `React` app? 
Make sure, you have installed `Node.js`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `python`.
Also install `pip install flask python-dotenv` to use api.

Start an app by going to `react-flask-app` and then `yarn start` to run `react page` and in new terminal window `yarn start-api` to run `python api`
